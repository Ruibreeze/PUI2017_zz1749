# Homework 2
# Author: Zhiao Zhou

## From here you could find my homework 2 which contains assignment 1 ~ 3 and the extra credit

## Assignment 1
In this assignment, I created a python script where if I pass two arguments MTAKEY and Bus Line to the script, it would pop up the current number of buses and their current locations

## Assignment 2
In this assignment, it's just like what I did in the first one. If I pass three arguments to the script: MTAKEY, bus line and the name of a csv file, it would create a csv file in the same directory which contains the location of the current buses and their next stop information

## Assignment 3
In this assignment, I chose a csv file in Cusp Data Facility which contains at least two columns with the numrical and plot them.

## Assignment 4
Assignment 4 is just like assignment 3 but the x-axis is substituted with a  time series
