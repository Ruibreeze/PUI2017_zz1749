### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

#### H0: The average percentage of weight lost by people in the test sample on a diet is less or the same as for the control sample
#### H0: Pt <= Pc

#### Ha: The average percentage of weight lost by the sample on excercise is lower than the sample on a diet alone
#### Ha: Pt > Pc

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

#### H0:  Average IQ scores for children whose mothers smoke (10 or more cigarettes a day) during pregnancy are the same as mean for those whose mothers do not smoke
#### H0: P0 = P1

**Food deserts contribute to the incidence of diabetes**


**Contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.
